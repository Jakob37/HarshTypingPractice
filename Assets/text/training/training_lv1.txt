I see a tree
Birds are singing
Flowers are blooming
On days like this
Kids like you
Should be ringing the bell
Keep the focus up
Keep the bow steady
Draw and let go
I will show them all
I will go to the mall
Become one with the arrow
Fly like a really small sparrow
This never gets boring
I can do this all day
