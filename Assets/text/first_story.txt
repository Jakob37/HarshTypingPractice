Type carefully...

# Title:The beginning
# Enemies:0
Once upon a time, there was a man called Arrow-man
He was an expert, like no others, at keeping Dangers at bay
His craft was his precision and care
One slip, and his people was one step closer to Dangers
He had to extort extrodinary care, or else all would be lost

# Title:The first encounter
# Enemies:1
# Speed:1
The first time he encountered a Danger, he already knew what to do
He had to tense his bow every so carefully
He knew, that one small slip, and so much would be lost
But he also knew, that he had to make it
"There is plenty of time", he thought
Be careful
*He let loose
And it was over

# Title:Some stillness
# Enemies:0
After the first encounter the time passed by
This were quiet, for now
Things were good, for now
But he knew that he had to continue honing his skills
He knew, that one day, he had to take action
Quickly, with high precision
He had to continue honing his skills

# Title:The second encounter
# Enemies:2
# Speed:2
The second time he encountered the Dangers, they were more prepared
*They knew about him
But, they seemed to test his strength
*They were not trying to overwhelm him, but to gauge his strength
They wanted to know whether he was careful
And they wanted to know whether he could react with speed and diligence

# Title:Ramping up the attack
# Enemies:5
# Speed:1
He knew something was imminent
*He saw a whole group of them coming in the distance
This time it was for real
*He held his bow steady, preparing for the shots
Then he let loose
*Arrow after arrow
His focus was like a bright spot in his mind
*The arrows fell like hail
The Dangers fell like wheat during harvest
*And suddenly, it was all over
A moment of stillness

# Title:Runners
# Enemies:4
# Speed:3
He knew he could not continue forever
*He knew that his calm would eventually run out
But there were no alternative
*He could not let it happen
His place was here, no matter what
*There were no rest, until he had mastered his calm
When standing his ground became second nature
*Then he could finally get some peace
--- New entry ---
# Title:The last attack, for now...
# Enemies:13
# Speed:1
*He saw them coming like in a haze
*For how long had be been letting his arrows loose on the Dangers?
*He didn't know anymore
*He wasn't sure that he wanted to know
*But he had to continue
*He had managed this far, hadn't he?
*He could manage one more day
*He could manage one more year
*Then he realized
*He no longer needed to worry
*He had reached his goal
*The dangers no longer fazed him
*And suddenly it was over

# Title:Aftermath
# Enemies:1
# Speed:1
His vision was hazy as the last Danger approached
It seemed to try to tell him something
He couldn't quite distinguish the words
As it came closer, the whispers got louder
...proud of you
You have mastered your mind
And therefore, you have mastered us
This is not the end, this is never the end
*But for now, you can rest
And then, everything turned white
